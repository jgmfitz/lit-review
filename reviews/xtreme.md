### Overview

XTREME is a new zero-shot test dataset for measuring generalization of multilingual models. The dataset spans 9 tasks and includes test data for 40 languages (though each task only has data for a subset of the languages). Fine tuning is performed in English, and zero-shot performance is tested in the other languages.
